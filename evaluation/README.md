# Evaluating the results in CASP15
The dataset generated from MULTICOM3 software for the CASP15 assembly targets is avaiable here:
https://zenodo.org/record/8057245

The protein structural models and analytical data generated for the CASP15 monomeric targets are available here:
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8215939

## Note
Due to the data restriction from CASP15, we cannot release all the protein complex structures, which are used in the analysis. Therefore, we provided the evaluation result in each folder.
